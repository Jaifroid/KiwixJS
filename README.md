Port of the Kiwix HTML5 app for Windows 10 Universal Windows Platform

This is a port of the Kiwix Offline Wikipedia (and other Wikis) reader for UWP on Windows 10.
It enables offline reading of a ZIM file downloaded from the Kiwix repository, including full
Wikipedia versions with or without images in many different languages.

This is a simple port of the HTML5 web app provided by Kiwix here: https://github.com/kiwix/
It is primarily intended for Windows Mobile, but if possible I aim to make it available as a UWP
Store App which will run on any Windows 10 platform: x86, x64, ARM.

The authors of the HTML5 app for Kiwix did all the work. Their source code runs almost "as is" on
the UWP platform. This initial port is by Geoffrey Kantaris. If you need to, you can contact me at
this email: egk10 at cam ac uk.
